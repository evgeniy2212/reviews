                You are selected one a star and we respect your decision, but in this situation we must ask whether this person was 21 years old or not.
                According to the existing rule ReviewsOnTheWeb.com with which you agreed upon registration, we are not welcome to put one or two stars to a person who is under 21 years old. We ask you to clarify the age of this person and only put one or two stars on this field. Users who violate this rule will be forgiven for the first time, but after the second such error your account will be closed.
                Please pay attention.
                Thank you.
